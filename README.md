# Premier-League

A football dashboard to show the recent, relative state of each Premier League team, with a focus on a simple, efficient, yet expressive and intuitive design. It includes visualisations, metrics and predictions. Created with Python, Plotly, Flask and football-data.org (thanks!). The system strives for transparency within the metrics and predictions so you can interact with it as a tool, rather than a black box.
